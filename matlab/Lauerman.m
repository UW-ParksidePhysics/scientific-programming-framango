%Goal is to plot a single graph of probability of a two state system.
%Probality equals the multiplicity of the macrostate over the muliplicty of the entire system, which is in line 43
%N is the total amount of chances of the system and n being the secondary amount.(ex. total amount of coins flipped is 100(N), with 20 head and 80(n) tails.)
% multiplicity of the entire system is calculated use 2^N, 2 being there because its a two state system and N being the total amount of coins flipped.
% multiplicty of a macrostate is calculated using Omega=N!/n!*(N-n)!
